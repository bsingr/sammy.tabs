## What

sammy.tabs adds tabbed-containers to [Sammy](http://github.com/quirkey/sammy).

## Ethos

sammy.tabs has, at its core, an ethos of
[progressive enhancement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement).
In order to provide a good experience for Javascript-less browsers, it does not
and will not feature things like AJAX-ily loading in the content of tabs
when they are selected.
